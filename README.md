# API-Scanner
An API scanner for ROBLOX. 

## About this project
This project was made for the sole reason of puzzling, because there are a lot of puzzles that still require ROBLOX API for some reason.
However, if you are a developer (or someone who is just curious), you can find information about a game or a group using this.
